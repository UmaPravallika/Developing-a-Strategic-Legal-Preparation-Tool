Problem Statement

In the fast-paced world of legal proceedings, thorough preparation is crucial. The goal of this project is to develop an AI-powered application that distills a complex legal document—“Amicus Brief on behalf of Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas”—to identify the top 10 key items pivotal to the case.

The tool should:

Highlight arguments for and against the case for a balanced perspective.

Provide precise references, including page numbers and line numbers, to quickly access relevant sections.

Enable the attorney to focus on critical aspects and prepare strategically.

Project Overview

The application uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques to:

Extract text from PDF documents.

Preprocess text to remove noise and tokenize sentences.

Generate embeddings for semantic understanding using Sentence Transformers.

Score sentences based on relevance to case-critical keywords.

Classify arguments as for or against the case.

Map references to original page and line numbers.

Select top 10 key items and present a summarized view for strategic planning.
